# thewire-websitecards


Attaches rich website preview cards to wire posts, similar to Twitter cards. The card will appear when a URL is mentioned in a wire post, and there is OpenGraph metadata attached to the URL with an image.

-   Cards appear on both "The Wire" and "River" feeds.
-   Support for OpenGraph.io API, or self-hosted OpenGraph finder by scottmac.
-   Support for custom card styling.

Also, I'm super pumped to be creating elgg plugins again! Would love to hear your feedback :)
